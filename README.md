# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection – URSS Research Project 2025

This repository contains my work from a summer research project at the University of Warwick, as part of the Undergraduate Research Support Scheme (URSS). The goal of the project was to explore machine learning models for detecting brain tumors in medical images (MRI scans).

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Investigate ML techniques for brain tumor classification
- Understand preprocessing challenges with medical imaging data
- Evaluate trade-offs between accuracy, complexity, and interpretability

---

## 🔍 Overview

The project involves:

- Loading and preprocessing MRI scan data
- Applying a conventional ML model (SVM)
- Exploring CNN-based image classifiers 
- Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Pytorch)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for analysis and experimentation

---

## 📊 Results for SVM

| Metric         | Value   |
|----------------|---------|
| Accuracy       | 96.8%   |
| Precision      | 97%   |
| Recall         | 97%   |
| F1 Score       | 97%   |
