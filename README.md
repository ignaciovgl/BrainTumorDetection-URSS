# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection – URSS Research Project 2025

This repository contains my work from a summer research project at the University of Warwick, as part of the Undergraduate Research Support Scheme (URSS). The goal of the project was to explore machine learning models for detecting brain tumors in medical images (MRI scans).

## 🔍 Overview

The project involves:

- Loading and preprocessing MRI scan data
- Applying a conventional ML model (SVM)
- Exploring CNN-based image classifiers 
- Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices
